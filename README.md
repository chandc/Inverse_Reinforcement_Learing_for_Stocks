# Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Stocks
In this project, we will

1. Explore and estimate an IRL-based model of market returns that is based on IRL of a market-optimal portfolio
2. Investigate the role and impact of choices of different signals on model estimation and trading strategies
3. Compare simple IRL-based and UL-based trading strategies

by implementing the model of Halperin and Feldshteyn (2012) for DJIA and SP500

Data and Jupyter notebook files are included so one can reproduce the results and make future enhancement.

**dja_cap.csv** - containes DJIA stock prices

**spx_holdings_and_spx_closeprice.csv** - contains SP500 stock prices

**SSRN-id3174498.pdfâ€‹** - the paper that describes the IRL model

**IRL_market_model-paper-multiple_stocks-with_next_day return_and_SP500.ipynb** - Python notebook

**tensorflow_optimization_examples.ipynb** - an example of using Tensorflow for minimizing the Maximum Likelihood function
